# Backend — RBAC Project

This repository contains the backend for the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) project. Work completed so far provides a runnable Express server and a project scaffold for data access.

Status

- Basic Express server implemented and running (`server.js`).
- Dependencies declared in `package.json` for runtime and helper tooling.

Key files and folders

- `server.js`: Express app with CORS and JSON parsing, listening on `process.env.PORT || 5000`.
- `package.json`: project metadata and `start` script (`nodemon server.js`).
- `data/db.js`: current database helper module used by the backend — prefer this for DB access in the current setup.
- `config/prisma.js` and `prisma.config.ts`: present but not used by the running server in the current state.
- `prisma/`: Prisma schema exists but is intentionally ignored for the present workflow.
- `frontend/`: placeholder for the frontend application.

How to run (local)

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Create a `.env` file at the project root if needed (for example: `PORT`, database connection string used by `data/db.js`).

3. Start the server:

   npm start

Notes

- The project currently uses `data/db.js` as the DB helper. The Prisma files are included in the repo but are intentionally not used by the running server; you can ignore Prisma-related files for now.
- If you decide to use Prisma later, run Prisma CLI commands (generate, migrate) against `prisma/schema.prisma` and update `data/db.js` or swap it out.

Next steps

- Implement API routes for authentication and RBAC models (roles, permissions, users).
- Replace or integrate `data/db.js` with a persistent database adapter (or enable Prisma migrations and generator as needed).
- Connect the frontend in `frontend/` and secure endpoints.
