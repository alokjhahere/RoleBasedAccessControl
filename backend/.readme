# Backend — RBAC Project

This repository contains the backend for the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) project. It provides a runnable Express server and a small scaffold for data access and auth routes.

Status

- Basic Express server implemented and running.
- Simple in-memory/mock DB helper in `data/db.js` used by the app.
- Authentication controllers and routes scaffolded (`controller/authController.js`, `routes/authRoutes.js`).

Key files and folders

- [backend/server.js](backend/server.js): Express app with CORS and JSON parsing, listens on `process.env.PORT || 5000`.
- [backend/package.json](backend/package.json): project metadata and `start` script (uses `nodemon server.js`).
- [backend/data/db.js](backend/data/db.js): current DB helper (mock/in-memory by default).
- [backend/controller/authController.js](backend/controller/authController.js): simple `loginController` and `registerController` implementations.
- [backend/routes/authRoutes.js](backend/routes/authRoutes.js): routes wiring for authentication endpoints.
- [backend/prisma/](backend/prisma/): Prisma schema present but not used by the running server.
- [backend/config/prisma.js](backend/config/prisma.js) and [backend/prisma.config.ts](backend/prisma.config.ts): Prisma helper files (unused currently).

How to run (local)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. (Optional) Create a `.env` file at the project root to set `PORT` or a DB connection string if you replace the mock DB.

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Quick notes

- The running server uses `data/db.js` as the DB layer. If you want persistent storage, replace `data/db.js` or implement a proper adapter.
- Prisma files are included for future use but are not wired into the current runtime. To enable Prisma, update the DB adapter and run `prisma generate` / migrations against `prisma/schema.prisma`.

Useful next steps

- Implement RBAC models and persistence (roles, permissions, user-role relations).
- Add JWT authentication and password hashing in `controller/authController.js`.
- Add tests and basic OpenAPI/Swagger docs for the auth endpoints.

If you want, I can implement any of the next steps (routes, migrations, JWT auth, or seed data). Tell me which area to prioritize.
